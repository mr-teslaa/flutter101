### Goals of this lesson

-   Stateless widget

    -   without `stateless widget` we need to manually reload the app every time we have changing something in our code. `stateless widget` helps us to reload the application aumatically.
    -   the shortcode of `stateless widget` is `stless`. after typing `stless` an suggesstion automatically popup and generate a stateless widget for us.

-   Stateless vs Stateful widget
    -   `Stateless widget`: the state of widget can not changed overtime. that means anything we are doning here can not be changed in the app. Like colors or fonts or it could be anything.
    -   `Stateful widget`: the state of widget can change over time
-   Hot reload
