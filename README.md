### Goals of this lesson

-   Colors & Fonts
    -   if you need to use custom fonts then you should download that fonts and place that font into separate folder like `fonts` or `assets/fonts/`.
    -   next step is to edit the `pubspec.yml` file. this file is the configuration file of your flutter app. _Note: you can call anything you want but it makes sense to call it it's real name_
